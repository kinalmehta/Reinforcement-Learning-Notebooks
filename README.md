# Reinforcement Learning Notebooks

While going through [SpinningUp as Deep RL Researcher](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/spinningup.html), I found it challenging to connect and understand the paper (theory) and available implementation (practical) of several algorithms.<br><br>

In this repository, I try to implement some of the most important, foundational Deep RL algorithms in a single notebook without any dependencies. There may be a lot of redundant code due to this.
