# Suggested Path for a beginner in Reinforcement Learning

Based on [my learning experience](./my_path_in_RL.md) and the resources I used for learning myself, following is the course I would suggest to someone starting new in Reinforcement Learning.

**NOTE:** This is my personal opinion and take it with a pinch of salt.

#### 1. Reinforcement Learning Specialization by University of Alberta [link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning)

- One of the best course to get you started in RL. Follow the RL book along with course, and finish all the reading assignments asked to do.
- It'll help you clear the concepts in tabular settings first and then extend those concepts to function approximation case.
- Alternatively you can also refer to [David Silver's course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ).

#### 2. Reinforcement Learning Textbook by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto [link](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf)

- Read the first chapter of this book before doing anything in RL. It gives a really nice introduction to the RL framework.
- The first part of the book covers tabular methods. The second part covers function approximation with RL. In the third part, various case studies have been discussed including AlphaGo and AlphaZero.
- The first part will almost completely be covered with the course. Some sections of the second part are covered in course, you can read the remaining sections to get better intuition and understanding.
- Going through the case-studies will give you a nice overview of how RL and Deep RL is applied in practical scenarios.

#### 3. OpenAI SpinningUp [link](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/index.html)

- Spinning Up is one of the most awesome resource to get started as a researcher in RL.
- It contains the list of key papers in RL and DRL research.
- OpenAI has also released [baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines), which contains implementation of various algorithms.
- One of the most important thing is writing your own implementations of various algorithms. It helps you clear your understanding and connect the theoretical concepts to its implementations.
- [This repository](https://github.com/kinalmehta/Reinforcement-Learning-Notebooks) contains my implementations of various algorithms. I have tried to keep the implementations as simple as possible.
- Alternatively you can also refer to [UC Berkley's Deep RL Course](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/).
