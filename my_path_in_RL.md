# My path in RL

Starting with reinforcement learning gets really overwhelming for a beginner. There is no clear visible path to follow and hence you have to experiment a lot to carve out your own learning path. <br>
Here I'll be sharing my own experience and the steps I took to get started, learn, and move towards advanced topics to application development or research.<br>

#### 1. Introduction to Reinforcement Learning -  David Silver's UCL lectures [link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ)

- This is the first course I started with. It gives a great introduction to classical RL in tabular form. This course if enough to equip you with all the **conceptual and theoretical** knowledge. It is a good place to develop your understanding.
- I personally didn't work on any code with this course.

#### 2. UC Berkley Deep RL Course [link](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/)

#### 3. Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree [link](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893)

- I had participated in one of the scholarship challenges on Udacity and got scholarship for this course. It is a fantastic course. A lot of my concepts got revised. It also help me get a better understanding of the classical control algorithms. This is more of a **practical** course. You have to implement various algorithms explained in their videos immediately. Though not a compulsion, its worth investing your time in the implementations as it gives your confidence about your own understanding.
- In case you **cannot afford to purchase** this course, you can try for scholarships. You can also use their [Github Repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning) and try working with the code samples and finishing the projects even without the videos. The repository and the notebooks are well documented and should suffice.

#### 4. Reinforcement Learning Specialization - Coursera [link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning)

- This course along with the [Reinforcement Learning Textbook](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf) is the perfect combination for a beginner.
